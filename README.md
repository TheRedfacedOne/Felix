# Felix
A Discord bot written in Rust. The name comes from iron (Fe) oxide (rust.) <br/>
It uses [dpermissions](https://github.com/rrredface/dpermissions), a permissions library I wrote specifically for this.
Discord's built in permissions don't provide a good enough way to give certain users access to certain bot commands,
so dpermissions was created to remedy this.
## Commands
- help - As you may have guessed, shows help text for one or all commands.
- strokes - Shows a graphic with the stroke order for a given Japanese character.

## To do
- Jisho command
- purge command
- source command
- config file
